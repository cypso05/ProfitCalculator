# ProfitCalculator
The selected Python code implements a simple web application using Flask that allows calculating profit from a purchase price and profit rate.

It starts by importing Flask and render_template_string from the flask module. Flask is a Python web framework that allows building web apps. render_template_string will be used to render a HTML template string into a response.

An Flask app instance is created by calling Flask() and passing name. This is a standard Flask app setup.

The @app.route('/') decorator creates a route handler for the root URL '/'. When a request comes in for '/', the index() function will be called to handle it.

The index() function contains the main logic. It starts by defining a multi-line string called original_html that contains HTML markup for a web page. This page has a heading, a form with inputs for purchase price and profit rate, a button to calculate profit, and a

to display the result.
When the Calculate Profit button is clicked, the calculateProfit() JavaScript function is triggered. This gets the input values, calculates the profit and total amounts by multiplying purchase price by the profit percentage, and updates the result div to display the calculated amounts.

The original_html string is passed to render_template_string() which renders it into a proper Flask response. This rendered HTML is returned from the index() function.

Finally, if the script is executed directly, the Flask app is run in debug mode on the local development server.

So in summary, this code handles a web request, renders a HTML template with a profit calculator form, processes the form submission via JavaScript, calculates profit and total amounts, and displays the results back to the user. The user provides purchase price and profit rate as inputs, and the output is the calculated profit and total amounts.
